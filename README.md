# Network-intrusion-Detection-system

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) defined as a Device or software application which monitors the
network or system activities and finds if there is any malicious activity occur. Outstanding
growthand usage of internet raises concerns about how to communicate and protect the digital
information safely. In todayâ€™s world hackers use different types of attacks for getting the valuable
information. Many of the intrusion detection techniques, methods and algorithms help to detect
those several attacks. The main objective of this project is to detect types of attacks, different
tools and techniques, That tool are capable to detect and prevent the intrusion from the intruder.
In our project we are using the IDS-2018 Dataset and NSL KDD dataset to test our models using
deep learning algorithms and some machine learning algorithms.
